# Hand Gesture Visualizer (Wayland)

A real-time hand gesture visualization tool for Linux (Wayland) using a webcam.  
This application **does not perform actual mouse clicks**â€”it visually indicates detected gestures and cursor position.  
Ideal for testing hand-tracking, training gesture recognition, or developing gesture-based interfaces.
