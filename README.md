# Hand Gesture Visualizer (Wayland)

A real-time **hand gesture visualization tool** for Linux Wayland using a webcam.  
This app **does not trigger real mouse events** — it only shows detected gestures and a visual cursor.  
Useful for **gesture tracking experiments**, **recognition training**, and **prototype gesture-based interfaces**.

---

## ✨ Features

- Tracks the **index fingertip** as a virtual cursor.  
- Recognizes gestures:
  - 🖱️ **Left Click (visual)** → index finger near thumb  
  - 🖱️ **Right Click (visual)** → index finger near middle finger  
  - 🖱️ **Double Click (visual)** → fingers close together  
  - 👆 **Move Cursor** → free index finger movement  
- Visual feedback:
  - Colored circle showing cursor position  
  - Text label with the detected gesture  
- Runs in **real time** with PyQt5 + OpenCV  
- Designed for **Wayland sessions on Linux**

## ⚙️ Requirements

- Python **3.8+**  
- [OpenCV](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/)  
- [Mediapipe](https://pypi.org/project/mediapipe/)  
- [PyQt5](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/)  
- Linux with **Wayland**  
- A working **webcam**  

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe PyQt5
````

## 🚀 Usage

* **Move Cursor** → move index finger freely
* **Left Click (visual)** → bring index finger close to thumb
* **Right Click (visual)** → bring index finger close to middle finger
* **Double Click (visual)** → fingers close together

The app shows the detected gesture and a visual cursor in the camera window.

## 📝 Notes

* No real mouse control is performed — this is a **visualization only**.
* Best results with **good lighting** and a clear view of the hand.
* Intended for **learning, demos, and testing gesture recognition**.
